Abstraction and encapsulation are concepts that complement each other but are critically different. Abstraction focuses 
on the observable behavior of an object and hides the implementation by providing a layer over the basic functionality. 
An abstract class is used. Encapsulation focuses upon the implementation of the behavior. Encapsulation is often achieved 
via information hiding, which is the process of hiding aspects of the object that do not contribute to its main functionality.
